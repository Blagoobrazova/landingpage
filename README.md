## My process

First I worked on HTML, then moved onto CSS. I made the footer and nav bar first, then - everything else, starting from top to bottom of the page's content. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Creating round corners;
- Creating an interesting design for the links in navigation bar 

### Continued development

I plan to explore the possibilities of the :hover CSS pseudo-class and to continue practicing using flex.
